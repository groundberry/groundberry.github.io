## The week

In week five we had our first contact with [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), a language for creating interactive web pages, along with HTML for the content and CSS for the style. It has been a very exciting week and very fun. On Monday I realised that my previous knowledge of this language was very basic. It has been very helpful, though, to have spent some time getting familiar with the syntax so that I can feel a bit more confident, even if everything we are doing now is completely new. We started working right away with prototypes, translating a previous exercise from Ruby to JS, and creating a thermostat using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to make the app interactive, and [Ajax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started) to get weather information from an external [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface).

## What I learnt

This week I learnt JS as a front-end language, and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to test our JS code as we did with RSpec to test Ruby. Being flexible and open to changes really helped me to adapt to the challenge of learning a new environment very quickly.

## Struggles

I struggled getting my head around a new syntax. I started the week worried that I wouldn't be able to cope with such a fast switch from Ruby, a back-end language, to JS, a front-end language.

JS week has been the best of the course so far. I could see more clearly how my code works, since we can run it on the browser. Building interactive applications is something I'm really interested in, and now I feel a bit more confident on how to turn user stories into practical and tangible solutions. Let's keep learning! üôåüèΩ
