This is the second post of a series of four where I'll show the main steps I followed to build [Flashcards](https://groundberry.github.io/flashcards-client/), a single page app that will help users study and learn any subject they want through spaced repetition.

- Part 1 - [The back-end]({% post_url 2017-03-18-build-an-app-with-rails-and-react-the-back-end %})
- Part 2 - User authentication
- Part 3 - [The front-end]({% post_url 2017-04-23-build-an-app-with-rails-and-react-the-front-end %})
- Part 4 - [Deploying to Heroku and GitHub Pages]({% post_url 2017-05-05-build-an-app-with-rails-and-react-deploying-to-heroku-and-gh-pages %})

The back-end is a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) app that will store the information provided by the users. The front-end is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a JavaScript library for user interfaces.

## User login through GitHub

We have decided to deal with authentication through GitHub, so that users don't have to create a new account, nor remember a password, in order to access our app. It'll make life easier for them, and also for us, since we won't have to deal with storing sensitive data. In the following diagram we show the flow of information between the user's browser, our server app, and GitHub:

{% include image.html name="authentication_flow.svg" alt="Authentication flow through GitHub" %}

Everything starts when the user clicks the *Login* button in our app:

{% include image.html name="our_login_button.png" alt="Our login button" %}

A `GET` request is sent to GitHub, and GitHub renders some HTML asking the user to authorise logging into our app using their credentials.

{% include image.html name="github_auth_button.png" alt="GitHub's auth button" %}

The user clicks the *Authorize application* button and the process continues. A `GET` request with a temporary code is sent from GitHub to the `/auth/github` endpoint in our server app, since that's the endpoint we entered when we registered our app with GitHub:

{% include image.html name="github_app_config.png" alt="GitHub's auth button" %}

We need to exchange this temporary code for an access token by making a `POST` request from our server app to GitHub's `/login/oauth/access_token` endpoint.

With this token we'll be able to ask GitHub for the user's information. We'll send a `GET` request to GitHub's `/user` endpoint, asking for the user's name, login, and avatar, so that we can authenticate the user, and also show this information in our app.

When GitHub responds with the user's information, we'll create a new `User` instance with it and store it in our database.

Once that's done, the user's login is encoded in a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/), and we redirect the request to our client app with said token in the URL. Now the client app can make requests to our API, and we'll be able to authenticate those requests and associate them to that user by decoding the token. The user can start learning!

This authentication process seems long and complicated, but it only takes a second to complete. Let's jump into breaking this mysterious process into small chunks.

## Getting the user info

GitHub's login flow follows the OAuth standard. You can learn more about it on [their OAuth page](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/). The main thing we have to do is exchange a temporary code that GitHub sends us for an access token. Then, using that access token, we fetch the user's information.

We decided to encapsulate this logic in an `Authenticator` class, which uses the [`faraday`](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday) gem to make requests to GitHub. We'll add `faraday` to our `Gemfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

# Bundle edge Rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails'
gem 'rails', '~> 5.0.0', '>= 5.0.0.1'
# ...
# Use Faraday as HTTP client
gem 'faraday', '~> 0.11'
```

And then create the `Authenticator` class under `app/lib/`, so that Rails autoloads it:

```ruby
# app/lib/authenticator.rb

class Authenticator
  def initialize(connection = Faraday.new)
    @connection = connection
  end

  def github(code)
    access_token_resp = fetch_github_access_token(code)
    access_token = access_token_resp['access_token']
    user_info_resp = fetch_github_user_info(access_token)

    {
      issuer: ENV['FLASHCARDS_CLIENT_URL'],
      login: user_info_resp['login'],
      name: user_info_resp['name'],
      avatar_url: user_info_resp['avatar_url']
    }
  end

  private

  def fetch_github_access_token(code)
    resp = @connection.post ENV['GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL'], {
      code:          code,
      client_id:     ENV['CLIENT_ID'],
      client_secret: ENV['CLIENT_SECRET']
    }
    raise IOError, 'FETCH_ACCESS_TOKEN' unless resp.success?
    URI.decode_www_form(resp.body).to_h
  end

  def fetch_github_user_info(access_token)
    resp = @connection.get ENV['GITHUB_USER_INFO_URL'], {
      access_token: access_token
    }
    raise IOError, 'FETCH_USER_INFO' unless resp.success?
    JSON.parse(resp.body)
  end
end
```

The class has one public method, `github`, which receives a temporary code and returns user information. It relies on two private methods to do the hard work:

- `fetch_github_access_token`, which receives a temporary code, and exchanges it for an access token by making a `POST` request to GitHub.
- `fetch_github_user_info`, which receives an access token, and makes a `GET` request to GitHub's API to retrieve the user's info.

You can see that, instead of hardcoding URLs and secrets, we are retrieving them from environment variables (e.g. `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL`, `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`), so that we don't commit them to our repo, as everything there is public! ðŸ•µ Also, it makes things easy to configure later.

In production, we'll set those environment variables manually, e.g. using [`heroku config:set`](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#setting-up-config-vars-for-a-deployed-application) if you are on Heroku.

In development, we can store those environment variables in a `.env` file, and load them using the [`dotenv-rails`](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) gem. We can add it to our `Gemfile` under the `development` and `test` groups:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

#...
group :development, :test do
  gem 'dotenv-rails'
  gem 'byebug', platform: :mri
end
```

When testing, we need those environment variables too, so we'll create a `.env.sample` file with dummy values:

```
CLIENT_ID="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
CLIENT_SECRET="YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
JWT_SECRET="ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"

GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL="https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token"
GITHUB_USER_INFO_URL="https://api.github.com/user"

FLASHCARDS_CLIENT_URL="https://groundberry.github.io/flashcards-client/"
```

And we'll load it from our `test_helper`, so that those environment variables are available to every test:

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb

# Load sample environment.
require 'dotenv'
Dotenv.load('.env.sample')
```

The important thing to remember is not to publish the real `.env` file anywhere, and to keep it safe in you local machine. You can add it to your `.gitignore` so that you don't commit it by accident:

```
# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
.byebug_history

# Ignore environment variables.
.env
```

## Encoding the user login

Once we have the user's info, we'll want to pass some of it to our client, so that it can make requests to our server, and the server will know which user is making the requests.

We'll use [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) to encode the information that we'll pass to the client. We need to include the [`jwt`](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt) gem in our `Gemfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

# Bundle edge Rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails'
gem 'rails', '~> 5.0.0', '>= 5.0.0.1'
# ...
# Use Faraday as HTTP client
gem 'faraday', '~> 0.11'
# Encode JWT tokens
gem 'jwt', '~> 1.5'
```

We'll encapsulate the logic for encoding and decoding information in a `TokiToki` module under `app/lib/`:

```ruby
# app/lib/toki_toki.rb

module TokiToki
  def self.encode(sub)
    payload = {
      iss: ENV['FLASHCARDS_CLIENT_URL'],
      sub: sub,
      exp: 4.hours.from_now.to_i,
      iat: Time.now.to_i
    }
    JWT.encode payload, ENV['JWT_SECRET'], 'HS256'
  end

  def self.decode(token)
    options = {
      iss: ENV['FLASHCARDS_CLIENT_URL'],
      verify_iss: true,
      verify_iat: true,
      leeway: 30,
      algorithm: 'HS256'
    }
    JWT.decode token, ENV['JWT_SECRET'], true, options
  end
end
```

The `encode` function receives a user login, and returns the encoded JWT. The `decode` function receives a JWT, and returns the decoded information.

## Creating the authentication endpoint

As we said above, GitHub will send a temporary code to the endpoint we configured for our app. In order to create said endpoint, we'll add a new controller `AuthenticationController` with a `github` method:

```ruby
# app/controllers/authentication_controller.rb

class AuthenticationController < ApplicationController
  def github
    authenticator = Authenticator.new
    user_info = authenticator.github(params[:code])

    login = user_info[:login]
    name = user_info[:name]
    avatar_url = user_info[:avatar_url]

    # Generate token...
    token = TokiToki.encode(login)
    # ... create user if it doesn't exist...
    User.where(login: login).first_or_create!(
      name: name,
      avatar_url: avatar_url
    )
    # ... and redirect to client app.
    redirect_to "#{issuer}?token=#{token}"
  rescue StandardError => error
    redirect_to "#{issuer}?error=#{error.message}"
  end

  private

  def issuer
    ENV['FLASHCARDS_CLIENT_URL']
  end
end
```

It uses our `Authenticator` class to get the user's info, stores it in our database, and redirects to the client app with some of that info encoded in a JWT by our `TokiToki` module.

And now we'll create a new endpoint in our `routes.rb` file that points to the `github` method in the `AuthenticationController`:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/auth/github', to: 'authentication#github', format: false

  # ...
end
```

We specified `format: false` since we don't need our endpoint to have a format (it just redirects).

If we have a look at our routes by running `rake routes` we'll see the new route:

```
$ rake routes
        Prefix Verb   URI Pattern    Controller#Action
   auth_github GET    /auth/github   authentication#github
   ...
```

## Authenticating users

For each request we receive in our endpoints, we'll want to know which user made it, so that we can return just the information associated to that user. For example, if we receive a `GET` request to our `/tags` endpoint, we'll need to return the list of tags for the user that made the request. But how do we know which user made it? Through the JWT token!

Every request must contain the JWT token as a parameter, so that we can extract the user's login from it, and retrieve the requested information from the database. This will need to happen for all endpoints, so we want to create a bunch of methods shared across all controllers. `ApplicationController` is the base class for all controllers, so that's the place where we're going to add them:

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb

class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
  def current_user
    token = params[:token]
    payload = TokiToki.decode(token)
    @current_user ||= User.find_by_login(payload[0]['sub'])
  end

  def logged_in?
    current_user != nil
  end

  def authenticate_user!
    head :unauthorized unless logged_in?
  end
end
```

The `current_user` method decodes the JWT token, extracts the user's login from it, tries to find a user in our database with that login, and stores it in the `@current_user` instance variable.

The `logged_in?` method returns whether we were able to find a user in our database.

The `authenticate_user!` method generates a response with a `401 Unauthorized` error if we could not find a user.

We'll invoke the `authenticate_user!` method before processing any request in our controllers, by making use of the `before_action` hook:

```ruby
# app/controllers/flashcards_controller.rb

class FlashcardsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  # ...
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/tags_controller.rb

class TagsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  # ...
end
```

Now we'll make use of the `@current_user` instance variable generated by `authenticate_user!`, to fetch the requested information in each method of our `FlashcardsController`:

```ruby
# app/controllers/flashcards_controller.rb

class FlashcardsController < ApplicationController
  # ...

  # GET /flashcards
  def index
    @flashcards = @current_user.flashcards

    render json: @flashcards
  end

  # GET /flashcards/1
  def show
    render json: @flashcard, include: :tags
  end

  # ...

  private

  def set_flashcard
    @flashcard = @current_user.flashcards.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

And do the same for the `TagsController`:

```ruby
class TagsController < ApplicationController
  # ...

  # GET /tags
  def index
    @tags = @current_user.tags

    render json: @tags
  end

  # GET /tags/1
  def show
    render json: @tag
  end

  private

  def set_tag
    @tag = @current_user.tags.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

# Updating our tests

We'll need to update our integration tests too, as they weren't prepared to deal with our authentication requirements.

In the `setup` block of our `FlashcardsControllerTest` we'll instantiate a `@user`, encode its login as a JWT token into `@token`, and fetch a flashcard from that user into `@flashcard`. We'll use this information in the tests themselves:

```ruby
# test/controllers/flashcards_controller_test.rb

class FlashcardsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  setup do
    @user = users(:one)
    @token = TokiToki.encode(@user.login)
    @flashcard = @user.flashcards.first
  end

  # ...

  test 'should create flashcard' do
    assert_difference('Flashcard.count') do
      post flashcards_url, params: {
        token: @token,
        flashcard: {
          answer: @flashcard.answer,
          question: @flashcard.question,
          user_id: @flashcard.user_id
        }
      }, as: :json
    end

    assert_response 201
  end

  test 'should show flashcard' do
    get flashcard_url(@flashcard), params: {
      token: @token
    }
    assert_response :success
  end

  # ...
end
```

Notice that we when we use `get`, we don't specify `as: :json`, since it'll try to send the params in the body of the request, which will throw an error since `GET` requests don't have a body.

We'll do the same thing for our integration tests in `TagsControllerTest`:

```ruby
# test/controllers/tags_controller_test.rb

class TagsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  setup do
    @user = users(:one)
    @token = TokiToki.encode(@user.login)
    @tag = @user.tags.first
  end

  # ...

  test 'should create tag' do
    assert_difference('Tag.count') do
      post tags_url, params: {
        token: @token,
        tag: {
          name: 'Some Tag'
        }
      }, as: :json
    end

    assert_response 201
  end

  test 'should show tag' do
    get tag_url(@tag), params: {
      token: @token
    }
    assert_response :success
  end

  # ...
end
```

After all our tests are fixed, we're ready to ship this! ðŸ›³ Let's move on to the front-end of our app.
