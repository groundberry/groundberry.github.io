Creating complex forms in a React app can be quite tricky. You have to deal with state management, validating user input, displaying error messages, styling, and so on, so things can get complicated fast.

One tool that we can use to make our life easier is [KendoReact Forms](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/forms/getting-started/). They provide a set of React components that we can combine and configure however we need, to help us build fully-featured forms quickly. They don't have any other dependencies, so integrating them into our apps is very straightforward.

In this article we'll use KendoReact components to build forms that validate user input in different ways (required fields, email addresses, etc.), display the appropriate error messages, and have a stylish and consistent look-and-feel.

## Getting started

To get started with KendoReact Forms, we'll first need to install the corresponding dependencies into our app:

```
npm install --save \
  @progress/kendo-drawing \
  @progress/kendo-react-buttons \
  @progress/kendo-react-dropdowns \
  @progress/kendo-react-inputs \
  @progress/kendo-react-intl
```

While not strictly necessary, we'll also be installing `@progress/kendo-theme-material` to use Kendo's Material Theme, which looks really cool. ðŸ˜Ž

## Creating a basic form

Creating the form itself is straightforward. We just need to put together the fields we want, and apply the necessary classes for styling:

```js
import React, { useCallback, useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@progress/kendo-react-buttons";
import "@progress/kendo-theme-material/dist/all.css";

const MyForm = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <form className="k-form" onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Sign up</legend>
        <label className="k-form-field">
          <span>Name</span>
          <input
            className="k-textbox"
            name="name"
            required={true}
            value={name}
            onChange={onChangeName}
          />
        </label>
        <label className="k-form-field">
          <span>Email</span>
          <input
            className="k-textbox"
            name="email"
            required={true}
            value={email}
            onChange={onChangeEmail}
          />
        </label>
      </fieldset>
      <Button type="submit" primary={true}>
        Submit
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

{% include image.html name="form-native-controls.png" alt="A form with native controls" %}

In that example we were using native HTML controls, but we can use KendoReact components too, if we need a more advanced widget like a `DropDownList`:

```js
import React, { useCallback, useState } from "react";
import { Input } from "@progress/kendo-react-inputs";
import { DropDownList } from "@progress/kendo-react-dropdowns";
import { Button } from "@progress/kendo-react-buttons";
import "@progress/kendo-theme-material/dist/all.css";

const MyForm = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <form className="k-form" onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Reserve a room</legend>
        <label className="k-form-field">
          <span>Name</span>
          <Input
            name="name"
            required={true}
            value={name}
            onChange={onChangeName}
          />
        </label>
        <label className="k-form-field">
          <span>Room</span>
          <DropDownList
            name="room"
            required={true}
            data={rooms}
            value={room}
            onChange={onChangeRoom}
            style={ { width: "100%" } }
          />
        </label>
      </fieldset>
      <Button type="submit" primary={true}>
        Submit
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

{% include image.html name="form-kendo-react-controls.png" alt="A form with KendoReact controls" %}

## Validating user input

When using KendoReact controls in our form, we can specify additional properties that will cause the field to be validated. For example, specifying `required={true}` on an `Input` will make sure that the field is filled out, while specifying `type="email"` will make sure that it has the right format for an email address:

```js
const MyForm = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <form className="k-form" onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Sign up</legend>
        <label className="k-form-field">
          <span>Name</span>
          <Input
            name="name"
            required={true}
            value={name}
            onChange={onChangeName}
          />
        </label>
        <label className="k-form-field">
          <span>Email</span>
          <Input
            name="email"
            type="email"
            required={true}
            value={email}
            onChange={onChangeEmail}
          />
        </label>
      </fieldset>
      <Button type="submit" primary={true}>
        Submit
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

There are other props like `minLength`, `maxLength` or `pattern` that allow even finer control over field validation. Feel free to explore the KendoReact documentation to understand how to use them.

## Preventing form submission on invalid data

User input gets validated right before the form gets submitted too, without us having to do anything. If the validation fails, for example because the user didn't fill a required field, the form submission will be prevented, and an appropriate error message will be displayed:

{% include image.html name="form-submission-required.png" alt="Error message shown for required field" %}

Different validations will cause different error messages to show up. Here we're entering an invalid email address:

{% include image.html name="form-submission-email.png" alt="Error message shown for invalid email address" %}

## Advanced styling

KendoReat Forms also allow us to customize the styles of our forms, while maintaining a consistent and professional look.

For example, we can make our fields render their labels inline by replacing the `k-form` class with `k-form-inline`:

```js
const MyForm = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <form className="k-form-inline" onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      {/* ... */}
    </form>
  );
};
```

{% include image.html name="form-inline.png" alt="Inline labels in our form fields" %}

We can also let the user know that a field is required by adding a `span` with the class `k-required`, or provide additional information by adding a `span` with the class `k-field-info`:

```js
const MyForm = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <form className="k-form" onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Sign up</legend>
        <label className="k-form-field">
          <span>
            Name <span className="k-required">*</span>
          </span>
          <Input name="name" required={true} value={name} onChange={onChangeName} />
        </label>
        <label className="k-form-field">
          <span>
            Nickname <span className="k-field-info">optional</span>
          </span>
          <Input name="nickname" value={nickname} onChange={onChangeNickname} />
        </label>
      </fieldset>
      <Button type="submit" primary={true}>
        Submit
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

{% include image.html name="form-required-optional.png" alt="Required and optional field indicators" %}

## Conclusion

KendoReact Forms components and styles take care of the tedious aspects of building forms, so that you can focus on the business logic. They give you enough flexibility so that you can configure eveything the way you need, but they provide a consistent user experience and look-and-feel, so that your app feels super polished. ðŸ’…
