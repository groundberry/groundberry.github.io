I'm completely new to coding. I started from scratch in January using online learning tools. I got hooked by watching videos on HTML and CSS on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/). After that, I moved on to learning JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/).

I decided I wanted to speed up my learning by joining a development bootcamp. After heavily researching all the alternatives, and reading other students' blogs, I decided to interview at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) in mid June.

A few days later, I received an email from Maker's coach Nikesh with awesome news: I had passed! He also suggested some options to get prepared for the course:

- Improving my typing skills with [TypeRacer](http://play.typeracer.com/) and [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/).
- Reading [GitHub's guides](https://guides.github.com/).
- Reading [Chris Pine's Learn to Program book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/).
- Doing some [katas on CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) every day.
- Doing [Ruby koans](http://rubykoans.com/).

I also found completing the command line, Git and GitHub courses on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) very useful as an ice-breaker.

Fast forward to September. Week 1 of the pre-course at Makers Academy is done. Time passed really quickly but I have enjoyed every single day. On the morning of August 29th we received a kick-off email from Ana, our pre-course coach, giving us access to the online materials, and providing some guidance and valuable advice. Also, all the students in our cohort were invited to a channel on [Slack](https://slack.com/).

We organised a meetup at [Google Campus](https://www.campus.co/london/en) on Wednesday. It was a great idea to share our first impressions and get to know each other better.

On the first week we covered the following learning goals:

- Set up our development environment.
- Get familiar with the command line, Git and GitHub.
- Complete a mystery challenge using the command line.

I feel like I have much more confidence on all those topics than just seven days ago!

What will week 2 bring us?
